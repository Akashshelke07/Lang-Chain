This repository represents a custom GPT system built using LangChain. It demonstrates how chains operate, from basic structures to more advanced implementations. The project also includes agents and shows how external tools can be provided to GPT models that do not have fully up-to-date knowledge.
The Google Search API is integrated to address the model’s knowledge cutoff by enabling real-time information retrieval when required. In addition, the system uses the Groq API with the GPT-120B model to ensure fast and efficient inference.
