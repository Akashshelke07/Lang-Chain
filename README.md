This repository contains complete learning material on LangChain, explaining how chains work—from simple chain concepts to advanced usage. It also covers agents and how tools are provided to GPT models that have limited or non–up-to-date knowledge. Additionally, I have integrated the Groq API key using the GPT-120B model, along with the Google Search API for real-time information access.
